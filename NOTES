Issue encountered: Original xbx code didn't delimit messages over TCP; working
on raw packets not guaranteed to work correctly w/ fragmentation, etc


Some note about atomic wraparound algorithm

Justify Switch to RTOS

Link-time optimization requires attributes to prevent optimizing out of
interrupt vector

64-bit division requires .ARM.exidx section. Adding this section requires
updating initialization code to account for moved .data section in ROM

OpenOCD requires patch and hla_serial parameter to select correct device when
using two Tiva launchpads as xbh/xbd


Issue encountered: i2c hardware does not have builtin pullup resistors

I2c control to receive must be sent before reads

XBD Response Buffer was too small for git revision request, causing buffer
overflow

Failure to reenable interrupts after atomic reads causes failure in
vListInsert() in FreeRTOS
 
va_args w/ long long requires stack to be aligned to 8 bytes

XBX stuff
In XBX tempfile needs to be reimplemented, does not exist on non-debian systems
as it is part of debianutils. REplace w/ mktemp which is part of coreutils

.data section of bootloader goes past FLASH_MIN_ADDR and gets overwritten by XBD
app code. Use lma_regions combined w/ LOADADDR


xbdSend modifies buffer to add CRC, do not directly send XBD_CMD constants,
        otherwise fault will occur

Stack painter has to have attribute to prevent inlining, which makes positioning
of stack beacon indeterminate

Stack must be 8-byte aligned

Hole support added to xbhtool- holes are filled w/ zeros

highrom to be avoided as it bloats code pointer sizes

debug stuff always incased in macros in order to string literals to be removed
during compilation to save size

msp430 hal strict aliasing disabled
